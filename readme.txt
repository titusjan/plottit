Installation instructions:

If you simply want to install plottit once, follow these steps:

1)  Go to the src directory
2)  Run the 'make.sh' script.
3)  Drag and drop the plottit.xpi file from the bin directory 
    to the Firefox window.
4)  Restart firefox.
    
If you are developping Plottit and get tired of dragging and dropping, 
you can replace steps 2 and 3 by running the 'make_and_install.sh' script. 
However, before using this you must copy the 'install.sh.template' to 
'install.sh' and edit the installation destinations in it.
