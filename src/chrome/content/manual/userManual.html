        <h1>TL;DR</h1>
        
        At the end of this document you can find some <a href="#examples">ideas and examples</a> on how to use Plottit.

    </section>
    
    <section id="user-interface">
        <h1>Plottit User Interface</h1>
        
        The Plottit pane will appear at the bottom of the window whenever you visit a Reddit discussion. It contains the <a href="#comments-table">Comments table</a> on the left, and one of the following items on the right: a frame with the selected <a href="#comment-text">comment text</a>, a <a href="#scatter-plot">scatter plot</a>, a <a href="#histogram">histogram</a> or a <a href="#treemap">treemap</a>.
        <p>
        
        When the Reddit discussion is loaded completely, Plottit requests the Reddit server for a machine-readable version of the discussion. This is then used to populate the table and draw the graphs. Note that because the Reddit page and the data in the Plottit pane are not loaded simultaniously, small differences may occur.
        <p>
        
        Plottit can be disabled and hidden by toggling the <img src="enableButton.png"  title="enables/disables Plottit" alt="enable/disable"> button in the Firefox navigation toolbar. When Plottit is disabled it will not send requests to the server so you don't have to worry about wasting bandwidth. 
        <p>
        The Plottit pane can be resized by dragging the separator. The vertical separator between the table and the graphs can be dragged to change the size of the graphs relative to the table. Drag it completely to the right to hide the graphs.
        
        <section id="comments-table">
            <h2>Comments Table</h2>
        
            The Comments table contains a row for each comment on the Reddit page. A comment has certain properties, such as the author and the score, which are listed in the tables columns. There are many of these properties, they are <a href="#table-collumns">explained in detail</a> later in this section. Most of them are hidden by default, you can configure which columns are visible by clicking the <img src="selectTableColumns.png" title="selects visible columns" alt="select table column" > button in the top right corner of the table. You can reorder the columns by dragging/dropping them and resize them using the table header separators. 
            <p>
            You can sort the table for every column by clicking its header; clicking the same header again reverses the order. The only exception is the <em>Comment</em> column. When you click on this header, the comments column switches between a tree structure and a flat list. In tree-mode, a comment is only sorted by comparing it with its siblings so that the structure of the discussion remains intact (this is also how the Reddit page itself is sorted). In flat-mode however, the rows are sorted over the complete discussion.
            <p>
            When you select a row in the table, the corresponding comment in the Reddit page will be highlighted. If necessary the Reddit page will scroll to the comment to make it visible. Conversely, when you click on a comment in the Reddit page, the corresponding row will be selected in the comments table
            
            <figure>
                <img class="screenshot" src="tableAndPage.png" title="Screen shot" alt="Screen shoft of comments table and Reddit paget">
                <figcaption>The comments table in tree mode showing a selected row and its corresponding  highlighted comment in the Reddit page.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            When the table is in tree-mode, you can collapse and expand the comments by clicking the icon before the comment text. Depending on your operating system this will be +/- symbol or a triangle. The Reddit page is also synchronized when a comment is expanded or collapsed.
            <p>
            
            When the table has the keyboard focus, the up and down arrows select the next and previous comment and the left and right arrow collapse and expand a comment. This allows you to easily navigate the discussion using only the keyboard.
            <p>
            
            Some of the columns, for example the <em>Up</em> and <em>Down</em> votes, are rendered in an <em>italic</em> font. This is to indicate that this value is fuzzed by the Reddit server to combat spam and therefore does not represent the actual value; it has been deliberately modified. The Examples chapter contains a section that examines <a href="#fuzzing">fuzzing in more detail</a> but, in short, the more votes a comment has received, the more this number is distorted. This is also true for the properties that are derived from the number of up and down votes, such as the <em>Likes</em> and <em>Best</em> percentages. Only the <em>Score</em> and <em>Hot</em> values are not affected because Reddit fuzzes the votes in such a way that these numbers remain the same.
            <p>

            <section id="col-id">
                <h3>ID Column</h3>
                This is the comments identifier. Every Reddit comment contains a unique ID that is used, for example, in a URL that links to that specific comment. 
            </section>
            
            <section id="col-page-order">
                <h3>Page Order Column</h3>
                This number represents the position of the post in the current Reddit page. The Reddit page can be sorted independently of Plottit by selecting the sort order from the menu at the top of the discussion (see the screen shot below). This allows you to sort the page by: date (old/new), score (top), controversial, hot and best. 
                <p>

                <figure>
                    <img class="screenshot" src="sortRedditPage.png" title="Sorting a Reddit Page" alt="Screen shoft Reddit page sort menu">
                    <figcaption>The sort menu on the Reddit page</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                There may be small differences between the Reddit page and the table order when you sort by controversial or best. This is caused by vote fuzzing. Also, when sorting by score, Plottit cannot derive the page order if two comments have the same score. Therefore it is convenient to have the original page order available as a separate column.

            <section id="col-controversial">
                <h3>Controversial Column</h3>
                A measure of the controversy of the comment. This is calulated with the following formula:
               <figure>
                    <img class="formula" src="formula_controversy.png" alt="controversy formula">
               </figure>
               If the difference between the number of up-votes and downvotes is close to zero, the denominator will become small and therefore the controversy will become large. The maximum with 1 is taken to prevent division by zero in case the number of upvotes and down-votes are equal.               
               <p>
               The <i>up + down</i> in the numerator causes that the contoversy increases when the total number of votes increases. For example, a comment with 5 upvotes and 4 downvotes is more controversial than a comment with 4 upvotes and 3 downvotes.
               <p>
               <strong>Note: </strong>this number is <a href="fuzzing">fuzzed</a> by Reddit and is therefore less accurate for comments having a lot of votes.
            </section>
            
            <section id="col-hot">
                <h3>Hot Column</h3>
                The hotness of the comment. This is a measure that tries to strike a balance between promoting the newest comments and the comments with the highest scores. 
                <p>
                The hotness is a relative measure; calculating the hotness of a single comment doesn't tell us much, it only becomes usefull when the hotness of one comment is compared to that of another.
                <p>
                The hotness is calculated as follows:
                <figure>
                    <img class="formula" src="formula_hotness.png" alt="hotness formula">
                </figure>
               
                Let's first examine what happens if the score is positive (the score is the up-votes minus the down-votes as usual). You can see that the hotness is the sum of two terms, the first of which depends on the <i>score</i> and the second on the time (<i>t</i>) that the comment was posted. The <i>log<sub>10</sub>(score)</i> makes that the hotness increases with the score but with a diminishing return; if a comments score would be multiplied by 10 its hotness would increase by 1.
                
                <p>
                The second term first calculates the number of seconds that have elapsed between a certain start date (<i>t<sub>start</sub></i>) and the date that the comment was posted (<i>t</i>). The start date that reddit uses is 2005-12-08 at 07:46:43 but it could be any date as long as it's earlier than the oldest comment. The  number of elapsed seconds is subsequently divided by 45000 seconds. 45000 seconds is equal to 12.5 hours so if comment A is posted 12.5 hours later than comment B, comment A will be 1 point hotter than comment B, provided that they have the same score. Comment B would need to have ten times the score of comment A to catch up with A in hotness.
                <p>
                You can calculate that, for yesterdays comment to be just as hot as todays, it needs to have about 83 times the score as todays comment. If a comment is exactly two days old, it needs to have a score of at least 6919 for to be hotter than a comment that is posted right now and has a score of 1. 
                <p>
                Comments that have a score of 0 always have a hotness of 0 as well. Comments having a negative score will have a negative hotness because the elapsed time divided by 45000 will be subtracted from the first term (which is smaller). Strangely enough, the first term is positive which means that a comment with a score of -2 is hotter than a comment with score -1 that is posted at the same time.
                <p>
                Because the time that a comment was posted doesn't change, a comments hotness can only change if its score changes. Reddit prohibits users to vote on comments that are older than six months so the hotness of these comments becomes fixed at that time. Calculting the score from the elapsed time since an arbitrary start date makes it easier for Reddit to archive and cache these pages than if the hotness were calculated directly from the age of the comment, which keeps on changing.
                <p>
                <strong>Note: </strong>this number is not affected by Reddits <a href="fuzzing">vote fuzzing</a> because it is directly calculated from the <a href="col-score">score</a>, which is unaffected as well.

        <section id="scatter-plot">
            <h2>Scatter Plot</h2>
            
            The second tab, named <em>Plot</em>, displays a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot">scatter plot</a> when selected. It shows the discussion as a collection of orangered dots where every dot represents one comment. 
            The position of each dot along the X and Y axes depends on the value of two properties of the comment, which can be choosen by means of the drop-down labeled <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>.
            <p>
            A scatter plot is often used to examine the correlation between two variables. If there is a high correlation, such as between the number of words and the number of characters of a comment, the dots will form a straight line; if there is little or no correlation, such as between the number of characters of a comment and the time that it was posted, the dots will be scattered all over the figure.
            <p>
            The figure gives an example that lies inbetween these cases: how the number of votes depends on the time the comment was posted relative to the start of the discussion. It is common practice to put the independent variable (in this example <em>posted after</em>) on the X-axis and the variable that depends on it (i.e. the <em>votes</em>) on the Y-axis. You can see a clear negative correlation between them, the number of votes decreases as the time increases.
            <p>

            You can zoom in and out by pointing the mouse cursor at your point of interest and scrolling up or down with the mouse wheel. If you double-click on the scattter plot the zoom level will be reset. You can pan by dragging and dropping the plot.
            <p>
            When you hover your mouse cursor above the X or Y axis, the axis will be highlighted in light blue. When this is the case, panning and zooming will only work on that axis, the other axis is temporarily locked.
            <p>
            When the <em>Autoscale</em> box is checked, the zoom level will be reset each time you open a new discussion or switch to another browser tab. When it is unchecked the scale will be preserved between discussions.
            <p>
            The comment that is selected in the table whill be hightlighted in the scatter plot by a bigger circle. Conversely, when you click on a dot in the scatterplot, the corresponding comment will be highlighted in the comment table.

            This tab contains a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram">histogram</a> when selected. A histogram will group values in bins and will draw a bar for every bin, the height of which depends on the number of times a variable occurs in that bin. In the example below, the UTC date/time the comments were posted have been counted in groups of one hour. There were 3 comments posted between 5:00 and 6:00, 8 comments between 6:00 and 7:00, etc.
            <p>
            You can selected which comment property to count by means of the drop-down box labeled <em>X</em>. The box next to it will determine the size of the bins. Not every combination of variable and bin size makes sense, some combinations will result in very small or large bins.
