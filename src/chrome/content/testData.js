Mars, most likely.  \n\n&gt;If you could impress one thing on young people today, what would it be?\n\nThat adults are not all they're cracked up to be.  And most of them are wrong most of the time.  This can be quite revelatory for a kid - often launching them on a personal quest of exploration, rather than of Q&amp;A sessions with their parents.\n\n&gt;You've always been an inherently funny guy. Will that transfer to your take on *Cosmos*, or will you seek to emulate Sagan's more sober wonder?\n\nExcellent question.  Sagan's \"sober wonder\" was a fundamental dimension of Cosmos's gravitas.  Something that we all in this new production deeply respect.  But I can't be something I'm not.  Nor should I be.  So right now we are exploring the best mix of sober wonder, charming humor, and intellectual depth.  I think we'll land in a new place, respectful of Carl's legacy, but allowing me room to express my pedagogical enthusiasm for the subject\n\n&gt;Who are the unknown scientists of the 20th Century that people should know?\n\nM. Burbidge, G. Burbidge, W. Fowler, &amp; F. Hoyle. Google them..\n\n**As for my own question, sir:**\n\nFirst, do you think dark matter is comprised exclusively of WIMPs? Secondly, is there any neat (I mean neat as in tidy, simple, beautiful) explanation of WIMPs you can provide?\n\nFinally, I want you to know that I consider you the modern Sagan. You are truly the most charasmatic scientist around; I respect Brian Greene and all, but seriously, he's the electron to your muon. You're around 206.7683 times the scientist he is; give or take a few millionths\n\n***Edit: Sir, thank you for your patience with reddit. You are, in every possible way, the Sagan of our generation.

Sagan&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;sober wonder&amp;quot; was a fundamental dimension of Cosmos&amp;#39;s gravitas.  Something that we all in this new production deeply respect.  But I can&amp;#39;t be something I&amp;#39;m not.  Nor should I be.  So right now we are exploring the best mix of sober wonder, charming humor, and intellectual depth.  I think we&amp;#39;ll land in a new place, respectful of Carl&amp;#39;s legacy, but allowing me room to express my pedagogical enthusiasm for the subject&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Who are the unknown scientists of the 20th Century that people should know?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;M.

Secondly, is there any neat (I mean neat as in tidy, simple, beautiful) explanation of WIMPs you can provide?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want you to know that I consider you the modern Sagan.

This has since been experimentally verified. Thus, when the astronauts spend hundreds of days in the space station going at about 17,000 mph, time slows down &lt;em&gt;just a hair&lt;/em&gt; for the time they&amp;#39;re going that fast. Comparing their sense of time to that of people rooted on Earth, the astronauts have traveled into the future!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buzzkill: The amount that time slows down is dependent on a velocity range from zero to the speed of light (about 670 million mph, or 3x10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m&amp;#47;s), so 17,000 mph is - relatively speaking - not that fast. That&amp;#39;s why they only travel so short a time into the future (again, &amp;quot;future&amp;quot; relative to us here on earth).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "levenshtein": null, "link_id": "t3_ngd5e", "parent_id": "t1_c38v908", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "o4d5qg27qd048b2b27a8396039691f2439e39d4e7ecf29237f", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"body": "So, out of curiosity, if an astronaut  was able to go at far greater speeds, closer to the speed of light, for an extended period of time, would the effects of aging be far less great on the astronaut than the time they were gone? \n\nTL;DR If an astronaut spent 10 years going near the speed of light, would they personally have less than 10 years worth of aging?", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "author_flair_css_class": null, "created": 1324161276.0, "author_flair_text": null, "downs": 0, "author": "Strangeglove", "created_utc": 1324136076.0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, out of curiosity, if an astronaut  was able to go at far greater speeds, closer to the speed of light, for an extended period of time, would the effects of aging be far less great on the astronaut than the time they were gone? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR If an astronaut spent 10 years going near the speed of light, would they personally have less than 10 years worth of aging?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "levenshtein": null, "link_id": "t3_ngd5e", "parent_id": "t1_c38vay3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "o4d5qg27qd048b2b27a8396039691f2439e39d4e7ecf29237f", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"body": "That's the idea!

My buddy and I (the only two sophomore physics majors) are coming to your lecture on campus in April!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have a large liberal arts core curriculum (60 credits), so majoring in physics is extremely difficult schedule-wise and damn near impossible to do without knowing you want to study physics beforehand. This, and that physics scares people for some reason, explains why our department is so small.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a science educator, any ideas on how to make studying physics more appealing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: I can&amp;#39;t wait for you to come to campus!! Any chance you&amp;#39;ll want to meet our small physics crowd?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "levenshtein": null, "link_id": "t3_ngd5e", "parent_id": "t3_ngd5e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "o4d5qg27qd048b2b27a8396039691f2439e39d4e7ecf29237f", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"body": "50% of my college education was in courses that had nothing to do with math or science.

In thermal physics I learned that temperature defined to be 1/T= (\u2202S/\u2202U)N. So, in English I can say that 1 over the temperature is equal to the change in the number number of states (S - aka Entropy) per change in energy while holding the number of particles constant (N). This does not suffice to explain anything to someone like my mom. I can try taking the inverse of both sides, resulting in T=(\u2202U/\u2202S)N and saying this in English, but it still does a big whoosh over peoples' heads including mine; Temperature is equal to the change in energy per change in number of states with the number of particles held constant. I've tried to rephrase this statement to: Temperature is the rate of change of energy as the number of states is varied and the number of particles doesn't change, but again, this is confusing as it doesn't seem to fit our everyday experience with temperature. I even tried to explain it with how a thermometer works, but then I blow my own mind even more because a thermometer is calibrated to measure this rate of change of energy per number of states by looking at the volumetric change of the fluid inside the thermometer, yet the number of accessible states in the object who's temperature is being measure isn't restricted to just possible positions (volume). So, it seems the thermometer is this really simple looking instrument that is actually doing quite a bit of magic.

In thermal physics I learned that temperature defined to be 1&amp;#47;T= (\u2202S&amp;#47;\u2202U)N. So, in English I can say that 1 over the temperature is equal to the change in the number number of states (S - aka Entropy) per change in energy while holding the number of particles constant (N). This does not suffice to explain anything to someone like my mom. I can try taking the inverse of both sides, resulting in T=(\u2202U&amp;#47;\u2202S)N and saying this in English, but it still does a big whoosh over peoples&amp;#39; heads including mine; Temperature is equal to the change in energy per change in number of states with the number of particles held constant. I&amp;#39;ve tried to rephrase this statement to: Temperature is the rate of change of energy as the number of states is varied and the number of particles doesn&amp;#39;t change, but again, this is confusing as it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to fit our everyday experience with temperature. I even tried to explain it with how a thermometer works, but then I blow my own mind even more because a thermometer is calibrated to measure this rate of change of energy per number of states by looking at the volumetric change of the fluid inside the thermometer, yet the number of accessible states in the object who&amp;#39;s temperature is being measure isn&amp;#39;t restricted to just possible positions (volume). So, it seems the thermometer is this really simple looking instrument that is actually doing quite a bit of magic. Anyway, can you help explain this definition of temperature in super duper layman&amp;#39;s terms? And I&amp;#39;m sorry if any of my above statements are incorrect; it&amp;#39;s been about 8 years since I was a physics student.
