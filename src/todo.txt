--- Version 1.0 ---



Table: disable double click / tooltip

Rename to graphit/plottit.

Performance best practices:
    - Use modules for jQuery?
    - on plot hover?
    - Use profiler
    
Make release.
    - Remove todos / code review
    - Hide/remove Debug column
    - Test windows / linux
    - No Jar files?
    


Cleanup:
    remove attributes from state that are present in user pages.

--- Version 1.1 ---

Tree map color per author
Better tick marks posted-after/ integers / when autoscale is off.

Load more comments.
Main page. User page.
Better handling of adjusting table column widths

Steal focus on page load? Only when configured to do so!

Error handling on Ajax time out
